text based platformer

> You're standing on the edge of a cliff, overlooking an ocean. It seems high enough that you'd perish if you fell. Ahead of you and a little higher, there's a floating platform. It appears as though you can reach if if you jump. What do you want to do?
> - Jump to the platform

> You managed to reach the platform! Behind you is the bluff. Below you and to your right is another floating island. A third floating island hovers to your left. What do you want to do?
> - Jump to the right
> - Jump to the left
> - Jump back to the bluff
